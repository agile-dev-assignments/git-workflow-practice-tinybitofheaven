***HackerRank*** is a site where people can practice programming challenges in different programming languagues. They have problems ranging from simple to very difficult for programmers to solve as well as challenges. It's a good method of becoming more efficient with programming skills to be more desirable from a working standpoint which is useful for applying to jobs and internships. Aside from that, the puzzles are also fun to solve. Additionally, they have many resources that are useful for programmers and software developers, including tutorials for topics like interview preperation and also learning programming languages.
